# Abstract

Background:  

1.Vehicles are now America's biggest CO2 source.

2.According to theÂ Energy Information Administration, in 2016, about 1.9bn tons of carbon dioxide emissions were emitted from transportation.

Problems need to solve:

1.Determine or test the influence of different variables on the emission of CO2.

2.What are the most influencing features that affect CO2 emission?

Methods:

1.Data understanding and cleaning

2.Determine the significance of each coefficient

3.Correlation Analysis(2 variables)

4.Analyze the correlation between all variables

5.Building linear regression models

Conclusion:

1.The observed data fit well with the regression model with a high R-squared value.

2.Engines Size is the most influencing feature that affects CO2 emission.

3.For Polynomial Regression, the more degrees we used, the higher R-squared we can get.

4.We can get a higher R-squared score for more features according to Grid-Search.

5.For the influence feature that affects CO2 emission of fuel type, diesel has the biggest impact on CO2 emissions. But demand for diesel remains high for medium and long-haul vehicles, especially long-haul trucks.

6.Although ethanol fuel has a negative coefficient on carbon emissions, it does not mean that the use of ethanol fuel is encouraged, because its energy conversion efficiency is low, and it will consume more energy and pollute the production process.
