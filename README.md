# Abstract
Background:  

1. Vehicles are now America's biggest CO2 source.
2. According to theÂ Energy Information Administration, in 2016, about 1.9bn tons of carbon dioxide emissions were emitted from transportation.

Problems need to solve:

1.Determine or test the influence of different variables on the emission of CO2.

2.What are the most influencing features that affect CO2 emission?

Methods:

1.Data understanding and cleaning

2.Determine the significance of each coefficient

3.Correlation Analysis(2 variables)

4.Analyze the correlation between all variables

5.Building linear regression models
